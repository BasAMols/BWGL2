# Your rule content
For javascript and typescript files we use camelCase for all variables and functions. Classes use CamelCase (capital first letter). Files always use camelCase, even if its for a class. 

For WebGL2 we use 
u_camelCase for uniforms, 
v_camelCase for varyings,
a_camelCase for attributes.
